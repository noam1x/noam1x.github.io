<h1> Helemets </h1>
<p1> There are different levels of blunt force and balistic threat rated helemets that were designed for their specific threat that they were created to combat.
 There are three basic levels, there are bump, frag and projectile rated helmetes. The bump helmet is rated for blunt force blows to the head and were developed for 
 paratroopers (PJS) due to the fact that they were not facing imediate ballistic threats but however they needed blunt force protection. The next level of protection
 created was frag or light ballistic protection, this technology was created to prevent shrapnal from injuring the opperator. Opperators have documented that their frag
 helemets have stopped rifle rounds eventhough they arent rated to stop those projectiles. Finally the last helemet catagory is pistol and rifle rated helmets that were

<p2> Both Engines are highly capable but both excell where the other does not which will effect what the rider is capable of and what the bike is limmited too.
The two stroke engine has the advantages of its lighter weight, less complexity and more power to weight than the four stroke engine while the disadvantages of
the two stroke is that the engine requires a oil-gas mixture to run becasue the engine has no system to lubricate and cool the engine internaly so the engine 
runs less clean because its burning a small amount of oil when it runs and this makes fueling up on the road more complex and a hastel when on city streets without 
premixed gas. The two stroke also can rev much higher then a 4 stroke due to its only two steps to fire unlike the four strokes four steps. The four stroke engine 
runs smoother and is easier to control but revs lower and has less power potential. The four stroke is much more complex and difficult to repair however the engine 
is loved for its consistency and reliability.</p2>
<h3> Gear and Extras </h3>
<p3> The gear you where when riding makes the difference of a couple of scratches and road rash compared to broken bones and brain injuries. The most important peice 
of protection that a biker can purchase is a helmet and the most important factor of the helment is the matirials used. Todays modern helmets are made with the best 
matierials companies can offer and are typically made up of high dencity platics and advanced foam that keeps the helmet secured to the riders head. The prevention of 
road rash and fracturing or dislocating joints are some of the biggest considerations when articles of riding gear such as gloves and jackets are made. There is variation 
in materials between brands and the two most popular types are leather which has been used for decades and newer materials such as friction resitsant fabrics that with 
the combination of dence plastics or fibers provide great protection, breathability and comfort for the rider. Motorcycle jackets and pants are also very important because 
they provide coverage for the majority of the surface area on the body, the special materials and crompression materials apply optimal protection in the case of a slide or 
a collision.</p3>
