<h1> Ballistic Helemets </h1>
<p1> There are different levels of blunt force and balistic threat rated helemets that were designed for their specific threat that they were created to combat.
 There are three basic levels, there are bump, frag and projectile rated helmetes. The bump helmet is rated for blunt force blows to the head and were developed for 
 paratroopers (PJS) due to the fact that they were not facing imediate ballistic threats but however they needed blunt force protection. The next level of protection
 created was frag or light ballistic protection, this technology was created to prevent shrapnal from injuring the opperator. Opperators have documented that their frag
 helemets have stopped rifle rounds eventhough they arent rated to stop those projectiles. Finally the last helemet catagory is pistol and rifle rated helmets that were
 clearly
 <h2> Ballistic Plates </h2>
<p2> Similarly to ballistic helemets, ballistic plates also have different ratings, materials as well as materials. There are dozens of different raings that plates 
are given which all mean different things. There are three basic levels that many operators would reccomend, there is lvl II, lvl III and lvl IV plates. The plates are 
rated to protect against everything from small calipers from pistol calipers such as nine millimeter to rifle rouds such as (M855). The lvl II armour can come in soft and 
hard plates and is typically worn by police and security due to it being light weight and not very bulky. The lvl III plates can stand upto multiple hits from M855 and is 
worn by some of the best military operators on the planet due to its light weight and supirior protection against rifle threats compared to lvl II. Finally the last level
 of ballistic plates is lvl IV >
<h3> Gear and Extras </h3>
<p3> The gear you where when riding makes the difference of a couple of scratches and road rash compared to broken bones and brain injuries. The most important peice 
of protection that a biker can purchase is a helmet and the most important factor of the helment is the matirials used. Todays modern helmets are made with the best 
matierials companies can offer and are typically made up of high dencity platics and advanced foam that keeps the helmet secured to the riders head. The prevention of 
road rash and fracturing or dislocating joints are some of the biggest considerations when articles of riding gear such as gloves and jackets are made. There is variation 
in materials between brands and the two most popular types are leather which has been used for decades and newer materials such as friction resitsant fabrics that with 
the combination of dence plastics or fibers provide great protection, breathability and comfort for the rider. Motorcycle jackets and pants are also very important because 
they provide coverage for the majority of the surface area on the body, the special materials and crompression materials apply optimal protection in the case of a slide or 
a collision.</p3>
