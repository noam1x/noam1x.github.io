<h1> Ballistic Helmets </h1>
<p1> There are different levels of blunt force and balistic threat rated helmets that were designed for their specific threat that they were created to combat.
 There are three basic levels, there are bump, frag and projectile rated helmtes. The bump helmet is rated for blunt force blows to the head and were developed for 
 paratroopers due to the fact that they were not facing imediate ballistic threats but however they needed blunt force protection. The next level of protection
 created was frag or light ballistic protection, this technology was created to prevent shrapnal from injuring the opperator. Opperators have documented that their frag
 helemets have stopped rifle rounds eventhough they arent rated to stop those projectiles. Finally the last helemet catagory is pistol and rifle rated helmets that were
 clearly
 <h2> Ballistic Plates </h2>
<p2> Similarly to ballistic helmets, ballistic plates also have different ratings, materials as well as materials. There are dozens of different raings that plates 
are given which all mean different things. There are three basic levels that many operators would reccomend, there is lvl II, lvl III and lvl IV plates. The plates are 
rated to protect against everything from small calipers from pistol calipers such as nine millimeter to rifle rouds such as (M855). The lvl II armour can come in soft and 
hard plates and is typically worn by police and security due to it being light weight and not very bulky. The lvl III plates can stand upto multiple hits from M855 and is 
worn by some of the best military operators on the planet due to its light weight and supirior protection against rifle threats compared to lvl II. Finally the last level
 of ballistic plates is lvl IV which is capable of stopping multiple (30-06 armour piercing rounds which i critical for our teir one opperators in the feild when all thats
 keeping them safe is thier ballistic plates.
